    abstract = {Integer division remains expensive on today's processors as the cost of integer multiplication declines. We present code sequences for division by arbitrary nonzero integer constants and run-time invariants using integer multiplication. The algorithms assume a two's complement architecture. Most also require that the upper half of an integer product be quickly accessible. We treat unsigned division, signed division where the quotient rounds towards zero, signed division where the quotient rounds towards -∞, and division where the result is known a priori to be exact. We give some implementation results using the C compiler GCC.},

    abstract = {We extend the work of Richard Crandall et al. to demonstrate how the Discrete Weighted Transform (DWT) can be applied to speed up multiplication modulo any number of the form $a \pm b$ where $\prod_{p\vert ab}p$ is small. In particular this allows rapid computation modulo numbers of the form $k \cdot 2^{n}\pm 1$. In addition, we prove tight bounds on the rounding errors which naturally occur in floating-point implementations of FFT and DWT multiplications. This makes it possible for FFT multiplications to be used in situations where correctness is essential, for example in computer algebra packages.},
